# DeepFake_Detector

## Building a deep fake image detection model that is capable of classifying images into two categories Ai-Generated or Real images using TensorFlow

# Problem Definition
* The model is used for the detection of deep fake or AI-generated images that 
  are now widely used for spreading hate speech and fake news.
  
# Project Report
[View My Report](https://vedant-ranade.netlify.app/static/media/mini_report.55e441ae371372989a4c.pdf) , This was our Third Year Project.

# Data
*We are using Kaggle data  uploaded on the drive can be downloaded from the following URL
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ericji150/nsf-reu-2023-sd-21
[E. Ji, B. Dong, B. Samanthula, N. Zhou. "2D-FACT: Dual-Domain Fake Image Detection Against Textto-Image Generative Models". MIT Undergraduate Research Technology Conference (URTC 2023).]

* For the Training dataset our project includes 10,000 Fake and 10,000 Real images which can create a bias so our project acknowledges these issues by reducing the number of fake images without affecting the accuracy largely


# Evaluation

* Prediction Probabilities should be more than 90% which is this project's goal to achieve

# Flask DeepFake Detector Web App 🧠🖼️

In the Flask_Apllication directory of the project, there is a Flask-based web application that uses a deep learning model (`my_model_1.h5`) to classify uploaded images as either **Real** or **AI-generated**. It also applies a watermark based on the prediction.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Upload images for classification.
- Detects if the image is real or AI-generated.
- Adds a watermark label based on prediction.
- Download the watermarked image.
- Fully functional UI with routes like Home, About, Services, Contact, etc.
